# TryHackMe Writeups

I feel that doing these writeups will significantly slow down how quickly I am doing TryHackMe rooms, but benefit me greatly in the long run. In the beginning of my TryHackMe journey I was going through rooms more quickly because I didn't know any of the tools (Linux, nmap, gobuster, metasploit, etc.). I used walkthroughs to learn the basics and for more awareness of what is out there. Now that I know the basics, it is time to slow down and really understand what I am doing. I still have trouble getting through a room completely on my own so hopefully this will help! 

My plan:
* Complete a room
* Do a writeup
* Read other people's writeups to see what I can improve on or learn about

I will also need to do a couple GitHub tutorials.
