# Hacky Holidays
## Created by Deloitte

This CTF was a month long. There were 3 phases that were released at different times throughout the month. I had a lot of fun on the first phase, but the team became busy during the second and third phases so we did not attempt those challenges.


We still managed to place 252 out of 1319 teams (1036 teams had at least 1 point).

The CTF was well put together and had a great looking dashboard!
