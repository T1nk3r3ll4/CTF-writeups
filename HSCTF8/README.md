# HSCTF 8
## A CTF run by high schoolers for high schoolers
### (I am not a high schooler, but it was good practice :))

This was the first CTF I ever did with another person, [@techguyrikz](https://twitter.com/techguyrikz). It was fun having someone to discuss the challenges with! This was a 5 day long CTF, but we only joined in the last couple hours before it ended. While we did not have time to finish a lot of the challenges, we did manage to solve 8 (although some were freebies that I did not include in this writeup).

These writeups do not include every challenge. The writeups are intended to be documention for me to remember some of these tools and techniques, and also a way for me to familarize myself with GitHub. I am hoping to see improvements in my writeups over time since this will be the first of hopefully many!

Things to do for the next writeup:
* Learn how to resize images.
* Include the original files and/or links.
