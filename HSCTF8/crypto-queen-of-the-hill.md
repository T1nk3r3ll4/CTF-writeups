## How would I figure this out next time without being told the answer?
The name of the challenge gave us a hint. Go to this website https://www.dcode.fr/en and search "queen" or "hill". There are a couple for "queen" and one for "hill". After looking at each of them, you will find your answer using the Hill Cipher.
